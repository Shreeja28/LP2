whta is the formula for grade
ChatGPT said:
The formula for grade in your Salesforce Grade object can be implemented using a Formula field based on the numeric Score field. Here's a common grading scale example:

🎓 Formula for Grade (Letter Based)
Assume you have a custom field:

Score__c (Number, 0–100)

Then create a Formula Field called Grade__c (Text) with this formula:

java
Copy
Edit
IF(Score__c >= 90, "A",
IF(Score__c >= 80, "B",
IF(Score__c >= 70, "C",
IF(Score__c >= 60, "D",
"F"))))
🧠 Explanation:
A: 90–100

B: 80–89

C: 70–79

D: 60–69

F: Below 60
